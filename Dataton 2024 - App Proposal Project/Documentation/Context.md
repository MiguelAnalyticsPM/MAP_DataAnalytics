## Project Context

### **Problem Statement**
The Datat√≥n challenge focuses on addressing the local issue of unemployment and underemployment, particularly for individuals whose skills do not align with traditional job opportunities. The lack of an efficient system to match candidates with job opportunities that truly leverage their skills creates barriers for both job seekers and employers.

### **Proposed Solution**
This project introduces a data-driven platform that utilizes modern analytics and intuitive design to:
1. Identify skill gaps and strengths among job seekers.
2. Provide an easy-to-use interface for employers to post job openings and specify required competencies.
3. Match candidates with suitable job opportunities using a recommendation algorithm.

### **Key Features**
- A user-friendly dashboard for job seekers to input skills and preferences.
- Advanced analytics to generate recommendations for both job seekers and employers.
- Visualization tools to identify market trends and areas for skill improvement.
